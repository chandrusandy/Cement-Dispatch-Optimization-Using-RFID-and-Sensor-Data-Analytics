# Cement Dispatch Optimization Using RFID and Sensor Data Analytics

This repository contains my internship work at **Aispry**, where I contributed as a **Data Analytics Intern**.  
The project focuses on analyzing RFID and sensor-based dispatch data to optimize cement truck operations.  

## Key Highlights
- Data collection and preprocessing using **SQL and Python**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**  
- Built **Power BI dashboards** for dispatch performance monitoring  
- Identified inefficiencies in truck-to-silo assignments and optimized dispatch turnaround  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- SQL, MySQL  
- Power BI, Excel  
- GitHub for version control
